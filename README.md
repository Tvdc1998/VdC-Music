## Why

Every open-source Jellyfin music client I've tried has the same gaps: background playback breaks on modern Android, offline is an afterthought, and Android Auto is perpetually "coming soon." Mellow fixes all three.

## Features

- **Offline-first** — all metadata synced to a local Room database. Music downloads with configurable WiFi-only and storage caps
- **Android Auto** — full browse tree, playback
- **Background playback** — MediaLibraryService with proper foreground service lifecycle on Android 12+
- **Lyrics** — synced LRC with tap-to-seek
- **Responsive** — single-column on phones, nav rail + multi-column on tablets, landscape layouts
- **Battery-aware** — GPU shader album backdrops pause when battery is low


The Android Auto implementation was tested entirely through Emu's built-in AA projection (no DHU or real car needed). Offline mode was verified by toggling network profiles. Battery-aware animations were tested by setting battery level to any value on demand. [See the full demo videos in the blog post.](https://blog.marathonlabs.io/blog/dogfooding-emu-building-mellow/)

## Tech stack

```
Kotlin · Jetpack Compose · Material 3 · Media3 (ExoPlayer)
Hilt · Room · Coil · WorkManager · jellyfin-sdk-kotlin
```

## Install

Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Malinskiy/mellow/releases/latest):

1. Download `app-release.apk` from the latest release
2. Transfer the APK to your Android device (or download directly on device)
3. Open the APK and install — you may need to allow installation from unknown sources in your device settings

## Build from source

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Android Auto

Since Mellow is installed outside the Play Store, you need to enable unknown sources in Android Auto:

1. Open the **Android Auto** app on your phone
2. Tap **Settings** → scroll to **Version** → tap it **10 times** to enable developer mode
3. Tap the **⋮** overflow menu (top-right) → **Developer settings**
4. Enable **Unknown sources**

Without this, Android Auto will not show sideloaded apps in the car display.

## Screenshot tests

168 screenshot test cases across 4 device configurations (Pixel 10 portrait/landscape, Pixel Tablet portrait/landscape). Run via Robolectric with native graphics rendering:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "dev.mellow.app.screenshot.*"
```
